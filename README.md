# week-4-game/ JQuery game

Overview

Create an interactive game for web browsers that dynamically updates HTML pages with the jQuery library. In this game the player will have to guess the amount or number.


Here's how the game works:

    - There will be four items of jewelry displayed as buttons on the page.
    - The player will be shown a random amount at the start of the game.
    - When the player clicks the jewelry, it will add a specific amount of money "spent" to the player's total.
    - The game hides this amount until the player clicks a jewel.
    - When they do click one, the player's score counter will update.
    - The player wins if their total amount spent matches the random amount from the beginning of the game.
    - The player loses if their amount "spent" goes above the random amount.
    - The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player will see a new random amount. Also, all the jewelry will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero. The game will show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
